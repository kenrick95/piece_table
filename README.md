Piece table data strucutre in Rust

## Why?

1.  Mainly because I wanted to learn to code in Rust, as it was one of the hottest language for the kids out there :grin: And learning to code by just re-learning programming wasn't that fun. So, why not take up the challenge to implement a data strucure to learn the language :smiling_imp:
2. Because recently I encountered this data stucture on [a post linked from Hacker News](http://www.averylaird.com/programming/the%20text%20editor/2017/09/30/the-piece-table/) and was quite excited on its ideas, especially after reading [the (unfinished) paper on this topic ("Data Structures for Text Sequences", Crowley, 1998)](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~crowley/papers/sds.pdf).

Note: By no means, the data strucure implemented here is practical nor efficient, as my main goal is to learn Rust itself.
